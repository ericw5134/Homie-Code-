Homie Code


README 
        
        Homie Code is a translator program. The design and concept of our project is to implement a web based translator program that translates human language to Python code. Due to the limited time, we weren’t able to fully implement the program into our website, but the source code for the translator program runs.


To run the code you will need to install a visual studio extension Live server (If you have Visual studio Code) on your device. If you don’t have Visual Studio Code, then download from this link: https://github.com/tapio/live-server.
