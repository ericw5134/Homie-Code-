## Project Info
2023 Mountian Madness Hackathon Project

## Summary
Homie Code is a translator program. The design and concept of our project is to implement a web based translator program that translates human language to Python code. Due to the limited time, we weren’t able to fully implement the program into our website, but the source code for the translator program runs.
